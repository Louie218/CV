  <p>Hello thank you very much for visiting my page. My name is Luis Alejandro Leon,
  I am 24 years old at the moment of creating this personal page. My Birthday is Febuary, 17, 1998.
  Im American but my whole family is from colombia which is where im currently living but I will be coming
  back to NYðŸ—½ since it is my Birthplace. Ive worked anything from parking cars in Valet to Being a resolutions
  manager for an American home warrenty company. I am an aspiring self taught Front End Developer, I have
  always been interested in tech but never pursued it cause i thought it was too difficult. With the help
  of some friends and family i was pushed to learn and am currently enrolled in a Udemy Full stack couse and
  a Treehouse Front End Technical Degree.
